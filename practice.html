            I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. My parents instilled that in me at a very young <br> Our
            summers, and a lot of our weekends, were spent travelling in our RV. <br> We did a lot of local trips here
            in ALBERTA but also went on some long haul journeys. <br> We drove to ALASKA, across Canada, and to Southern
            California, just to name a few. I loved <br> seeing new places and learning about the history and culture.
            Social Studies was always my <br> favourite subject in school.
